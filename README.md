# Overview
I've learned a lot since I made the initial iteration of my personal portfolio/website, so I decided to take some time and revamp it.
My goal is to make the site reflect me and what I enjoy about computers and software in general, as well as challenging technical components.

# Updates 
- Initial release of proof of concept to show how a terminal can be emulated and used, mocked up in a few hours using Vue.
