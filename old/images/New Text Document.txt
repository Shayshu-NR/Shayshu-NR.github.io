							Hi I'm Shayshu, I'm a second year Computer engineering student at the University of Toronto. 
							In particular, I'm speacializing in software engineering with a minor in artificial intelligence.
						</p>
						<p>
							Over the past few years I've become increasingly intrested in complex analysis, computational chemistry, data science, and 
							biocomputation. 
						</p>
						<p>
							In the future, once I'm done undergrad, I'd like to pursue graduate studies in applied math or computer science.
							But for now I'm keeping myself busy with a few projects here and there...
						</p>
						<p>
							I’ve done work on designing and prototyping haptic feedback apps, small scale seed blanchers, and route optimization for city commuting. 
							Furthermore, I’ve done web development and UX/UI design for a few clients.
							More recently, I headed up research and market strategy outreach at a not-for-profit organization called STEM Camp Foundation.
